# CoxBuddy
CoxBuddy is an Android mobile application for coxswains (rowing) that tracks boat statisitics in real time. CoxBuddy preforms the same function as a [CoxBox](https://nksports.com/coxbox-gps). 
## What does CoxBuddy do?
In crew, the coxswain is the member who does not row but steers the boat and faces forward, towards the front.
The coxswain is responsible for steering the boat and cordinating the workouts, which involves knowing several statistics that the Coxswain
need to know in real time. Normally, Coxswains use a device called a CoxBox, but these can be innaccessable to some crews as they can cost upwards
of [$500](https://nksports.com/coxbox-gps). CoxBuddy can show that same statistics that a CoxBox for free! <br>

CoxBuddy shows:<br>
* Split (Unit of speed in rowing)
* Distance
* Strokes per Minute(SPM)
* Time elapsed (Chronomter)
* Current acceleration graphed <br>
## What I learned:
